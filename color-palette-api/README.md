# UF-API_GROUP (Color Palette API Branch)

This branch is for the development of the Color Palette API. This API takes in an image and returns a color palette with 16 colors using the medium cut algorithm, which is a modified version of merge sort for RGB colors. For more information, click [here.](https://medium.com/@gytterberg_14295/the-median-cut-algorithm-for-color-quantization-cc1128a0c534)

Note: The API is working as is.
