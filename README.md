# UF-API-GROUP (LEETCODE API BRANCH)

This branch is for the development of the Leetcode API. Upon being given a username, `request` and `BeautifulSoup` scrape and parse the necessary data *(number of completed problems, ranking, etc.)* This data is then stored in an object and is returned.

Note: The API is not currently functional.
